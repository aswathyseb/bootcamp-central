```{r Normal1}
x=rnorm(1000,mean=2,sd=3)
hist(x,main="N(2,9)",xlab="Random Numbers",nclass=50)

```

Generate the phenotypic scores as 20 random normals. Call this vector pheno.

```{r Normal}
nsamples=20
pheno = rnorm(nsamples)
```

Generate the gene expression scores as a matrix with 1000 rows (genes) and 20 columns (samples). Call this matrix genes.

```{r GeneExpression }
ngenes=1000

scores=rnorm(nsamples*ngenes)
genes=matrix(scores,nrow=1000,ncol=20)
```

Compute the 1000 correlations between the phenotypic scores and the gene expression scores. Note that you will need to transpose the gene expression matrix to do this. 

```{r Correlation}
cors=cor(t(genes),pheno)
```

visualization
```{r histCor}
hist(cors,nclass=50,xlab="Correlations",main="Correlation between Gene Expression and Phenotype")
```
